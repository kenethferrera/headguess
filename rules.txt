GAME RULES

Guess the Word (Forehead Mode)
1. Players take turns as the guesser. The guesser holds the device to their forehead so only others can see the word.
2. The guesser can ask for a clue; teammates give brief verbal hints.
3. Forbidden: saying the word (or parts), spelling, rhyming, or translations. No acting (use Charades for that).
4. When the guesser says the exact word, it counts as 1 point and the next word is shown.
5. If stuck, the group may say “Pass” (0 points) and move on.
6. Play until the timer ends; then rotate to the next guesser and continue.
7. After all players have taken turns (or after the agreed rounds), highest total points wins.

Charades (Multiplayer)
1. One or more actors perform the word using only gestures and body language.
2. Forbidden: speaking, mouthing letters, writing, or props that reveal the word.
3. Guessers may call out answers anytime; only exact matches score.
4. Each correct word is 1 point; you may pass to skip (0 points).
5. Rotate actors each round; play for a timer or set word count.
6. Team with the highest total points wins.

Impostor (Multiplayer)
1. Everyone receives the same secret word except the impostor(s).
2. In order, each player gives one short clue about “their” word.
3. Clues must be truthful but not so obvious that they expose the word.
4. After one clue round (or two, if agreed), all players discuss briefly.
5. Vote simultaneously on who the impostor is (no self‑vote unless agreed).
6. If the impostor is caught, the group wins; if not, the impostor wins.
7. Optional: scoring across rounds (caught impostor = group +1; escaped = impostor +1). Highest total wins.

YES/NO (Party Mode)
1. One player is the guesser; they cannot see the word (phone to forehead).
2. The guesser may only ask YES/NO questions to discover the word.
3. Others must answer only YES or NO; no extra clues, acting, or spelling.
4. Correct answer = 1 point and advance to the next word; “Pass” = 0 points.
5. Play until the timer ends; rotate the guesser next round.
6. Highest total points after the agreed number of rounds wins.

Multiplayer Note
1. In multiplayer modes, each player’s device receives its own word/role during rounds.
2. Do not reveal your word to others unless the rules specify (e.g., after voting in Impostor).
